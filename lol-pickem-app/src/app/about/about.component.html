    About Lol Pick'em!
  </h1>
  <p>
    Welcome to my Lol Pick'em app! This is meant to be a light-hearted, quick
    and easy game to play without a huge time commitment but that still gives
    people opportunity to think about League of Legends, strategy, meta, etc.
    The game is quite simple: you are presented with a real Lol game's team
    composition and you choose which team you think won. To check it out, head
    over to the
    <a routerLink="/play" title="Link to Play Page">play page</a> and click the
    "play" button
  </p>

      Why do you have to make an account?
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        This is a free app, using a developer API key from Riot, thus I need to
        be able to restrict traffic from the open internet
      </li>
      <li>
        You can either
        <a href="" (click)="auth.login()" title="Make An Account Link">
          create an account
        </a>
